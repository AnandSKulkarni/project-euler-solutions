# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For an integer M, we define R(M) as the sum of 1/(p\xc2\xb7q) for all the integer pairs p and q which satisfy all of these conditions:\n\n 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 p < q \xe2\x89\xa4 M\n p + q \xe2\x89\xa5 M\n p and q are coprime.\n\nWe also define S(N) as the sum of R(i) for 2 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\nWe can verify that S(2) = R(2) = 1/2, S(10) \xe2\x89\x88 6.9147 and S(100) \xe2\x89\x88 58.2962.\n\n\nFind S(107). Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.'
