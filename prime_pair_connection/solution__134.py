# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the consecutive primes p1 = 19 and p2 = 23. It can be verified that 1219 is the smallest number such that the last digits are formed by p1 whilst also being divisible by p2.\nIn fact, with the exception of p1 = 3 and p2 = 5, for every pair of consecutive primes, p2 > p1, there exist values of n for which the last digits are formed by p1 and n is divisible by p2. Let S be the smallest of these values of n.\nFind \xe2\x88\x91 S for every pair of consecutive primes with 5 \xe2\x89\xa4 p1 \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000.'
