# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the following algorithm for sorting a list:\n1. Starting from the beginning of the list, check each pair of adjacent elements in turn.\n2. If the elements are out of order:\na. Move the smallest element of the pair at the beginning of the list.\nb. Restart the process from step 1.\n3. If all pairs are in order, stop.For example, the list { 4 1 3 2 } is sorted as follows:\n4 1 3 2  (4 and 1 are out of order so move 1 to the front of the list)\n1 4 3 2  (4 and 3 are out of order so move 3 to the front of the list)\n3 1 4 2  (3 and 1 are out of order so move 1 to the front of the list)\n1 3 4 2  (4 and 2 are out of order so move 2 to the front of the list)\n2 1 3 4  (2 and 1 are out of order so move 1 to the front of the list)\n1 2 3 4  (The list is now sorted)Let F(L) be the number of times step 2a is executed to sort list L. For example, F({ 4 1 3 2 }) = 5.\n\nLet E(n) be the expected value of F(P) over all permutations P of the integers {1, 2, ..., n}.\nYou are given E(4) = 3.25 and E(10) = 115.725.\n\nFind E(30). Give your answer rounded to two digits after the decimal point.'
