# Problem Statement 
'''
5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed 5.
5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.
Let S(L) be the sum of the numbers n not exceeding L such that Euler's totient function Ï†(n) is a Hamming number.
S(100)=3728.


Find S(1012). Give your answer modulo 232.
