# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the number 48.\nThere are five pairs of integers $a$ and $b$ ($a \\leq b$) such that $a \\times b=48$: (1,48), (2,24), (3,16), (4,12) and (6,8).\nIt can be seen that both 6 and 8 have 4 divisors.\nSo of those five pairs one consists of two integers with the same number of divisors.\n\nIn general:\nLet $C(n)$ be the number of pairs of positive integers $a \\times b=n$, ($a \\leq b$) such that $a$ and $b$ have the same number of divisors; so $C(48)=1$.\n\n\nYou are given $C(10!)=3$: (1680, 2160), (1800, 2016) and (1890,1920). \nFind $C(100!)$'
