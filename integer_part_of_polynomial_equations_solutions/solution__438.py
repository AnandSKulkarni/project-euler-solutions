# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For an n-tuple of integers t = (a1, ..., an), let (x1, ..., xn) be the solutions of the polynomial equation xn + a1xn-1 + a2xn-2 + ... + an-1x + an = 0.\n\n\nConsider the following two conditions:\nx1, ..., xn are all real.\nIf x1, ..., xn are sorted, \xe2\x8c\x8axi\xe2\x8c\x8b = i for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n. (\xe2\x8c\x8a\xc2\xb7\xe2\x8c\x8b: floor function.)\n\nIn the case of n = 4, there are 12 n-tuples of integers which satisfy both conditions.\nWe define S(t) as the sum of the absolute values of the integers in t.\nFor n = 4 we can verify that \xe2\x88\x91S(t) = 2087 for all n-tuples t which satisfy both conditions.\n\n\nFind \xe2\x88\x91S(t) for n = 7.'
