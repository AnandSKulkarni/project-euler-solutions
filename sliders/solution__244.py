# Problem Statement 
'''
b'You probably know the game Fifteen Puzzle. Here, instead of numbered tiles, we have seven red tiles and eight blue tiles.\nA move is denoted by the uppercase initial of the direction (Left, Right, Up, Down) in which the tile is slid, e.g. starting from configuration (S), by the sequence LULUR we reach the configuration (E):\n\n(S),\xc2\xa0(E)\n\n\nFor each path, its checksum is calculated by (pseudocode):\n\nchecksum = 0\nchecksum = (checksum \xc3\x97 243 + m1) mod 100\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x89007\nchecksum = (checksum \xc3\x97 243 + m2) mod 100\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x89007\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\nchecksum = (checksum \xc3\x97 243 + mn) mod 100\xe2\x80\x89000\xe2\x80\x89007\nwhere mk is the ASCII value of the kth letter in the move sequence and the ASCII values for the moves are:\n\n\nL76R82U85D68\n\nFor the sequence LULUR given above, the checksum would be 19761398.\nNow, starting from configuration (S),\nfind all shortest ways to reach configuration (T).\n\n(S),\xc2\xa0(T)\n\n\nWhat is the sum of all checksums for the paths having the minimal length?'
