# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, n, for which the equation, x2 \xe2\x88\x92 y2 \xe2\x88\x92 z2 = n, has exactly two solutions is n = 27:\n342 \xe2\x88\x92 272 \xe2\x88\x92 202 = 122 \xe2\x88\x92 92 \xe2\x88\x92 62 = 27\nIt turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.\nHow many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?'
