# Problem Statement 
'''
b'An m\xc3\x97n maze is an m\xc3\x97n rectangular grid with walls placed between grid cells such that there is exactly one path from the top-left square to any other square. The following are examples of a 9\xc3\x9712 maze and a 15\xc3\x9720 maze:\n\n\n\n\nLet C(m,n) be the number of distinct m\xc3\x97n mazes. Mazes which can be formed by rotation and reflection from another maze are considered distinct.\n\n\nIt can be verified that C(1,1) = 1, C(2,2) = 4, C(3,4) = 2415, and C(9,12) = 2.5720e46 (in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits).\nFind C(100,500) and write your answer in scientific notation rounded to 5 significant digits.\n\n\nWhen giving your answer, use a lowercase e to separate mantissa and exponent.\nE.g. if the answer is 1234567891011 then the answer format would be 1.2346e12.'
