# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers $a, b$ and $c$ satisfying $a^2+b^2=c^2$.\nThe triple is called primitive if $a, b$ and $c$ are relatively prime.\nLet P($n$) be the number of primitive Pythagorean triples with $a < b < c \\le n$.\nFor example P(20) = 3, since there are three triples: (3,4,5), (5,12,13) and (8,15,17).\n\n\nYou are given that P(106) = 159139.\nFind P(3141592653589793).'
