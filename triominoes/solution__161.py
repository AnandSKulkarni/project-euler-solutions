# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A triomino is a shape consisting of three squares joined via the edges.\nThere are two basic forms:\n\n\n\nIf all possible orientations are taken into account there are six:\n\n\n\nAny n by m grid for which nxm is divisible by 3 can be tiled with triominoes.\nIf we consider tilings that can be obtained by reflection or rotation from another tiling as different there are 41 ways a 2 by 9 grid can be  tiled with triominoes:\n\n\n\nIn how many ways can a 9 by 12 grid be tiled in this way by triominoes?'
