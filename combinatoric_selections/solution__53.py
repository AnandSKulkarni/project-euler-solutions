# Problem Statement 
'''
b'There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:\n123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345\nIn combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.\nIn general,\n\nnCr = \nn!r!(n\xe2\x88\x92r)!\n,where r \xe2\x89\xa4 n, n! = n\xc3\x97(n\xe2\x88\x921)\xc3\x97...\xc3\x973\xc3\x972\xc3\x971, and 0! = 1.\n\nIt is not until n = 23, that a value exceeds one-million: 23C10 = 1144066.\nHow many, not necessarily distinct, values of \xc2\xa0nCr, for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100, are greater than one-million?'
