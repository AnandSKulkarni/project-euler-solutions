# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A binary matrix is a matrix consisting entirely of 0s and 1s. Consider the following transformations that can be performed on a binary matrix:\n\nSwap any two rows\nSwap any two columns\nFlip all elements in a single row (1s become 0s, 0s become 1s)\nFlip all elements in a single column\nTwo binary matrices $A$ and $B$ will be considered equivalent if there is a sequence of such transformations that when applied to $A$ yields $B$. For example, the following two matrices are equivalent:\n$A=\\begin{pmatrix} \n  1 & 0 & 1 \\\\ \n  0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} \\quad B=\\begin{pmatrix} \n  0 & 0 & 0 \\\\ \n  1 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n  0 & 0 & 1 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}$\nvia the sequence of two transformations "Flip all elements in column 3" followed by "Swap rows 1 and 2".\n\nDefine $c(n)$ to be the maximum number of $n\\times n$ binary matrices that can be found such that no two are equivalent. For example, $c(3)=3$. You are also given that $c(5)=39$ and $c(8)=656108$.\n\nFind $c(20)$, and give your answer modulo $1\\,001\\,001\\,011$.'
