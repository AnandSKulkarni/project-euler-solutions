# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.\nThe largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.\nWe shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed the square root of n the pseudo square root (PSR) of n.\nIt can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.\n\n\nLet p be the product of the primes below 190.\nFind PSR(p) mod 1016.'
