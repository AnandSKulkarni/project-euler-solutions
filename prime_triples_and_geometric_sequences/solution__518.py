# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let S(n) = \xce\xa3 a+b+c over all triples (a,b,c) such that:\n\na, b, and c are prime numbers.\na < b < c < n.\na+1, b+1, and c+1 form a geometric sequence.\nFor example, S(100) = 1035 with the following triples: \n\n(2, 5, 11), (2, 11, 47), (5, 11, 23), (5, 17, 53), (7, 11, 17), (7, 23, 71), (11, 23, 47), (17, 23, 31), (17, 41, 97), (31, 47, 71), (71, 83, 97)\n\nFind S(108).'
