# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For integers a and b, we define D(a, b) as the domain enclosed by the parabola y = x2 and the line y = a\xc2\xb7x + b:D(a, b) = { (x, y) | x2 \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 a\xc2\xb7x + b }.\n\n\nL(a, b) is defined as the number of lattice points contained in D(a, b).\nFor example, L(1, 2) = 8 and L(2, -1) = 1.\n\n\nWe also define S(N) as the sum of L(a, b) for all the pairs (a, b) such that the area of D(a, b) is a rational number and |a|,|b| \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\nWe can verify that S(5) = 344 and S(100) = 26709528.\n\n\nFind S(1012). Give your answer mod 108.'
