# Problem Statement 
'''
b'As we all know the equation x2=-1 has no solutions for real x.\n\nIf we however introduce the imaginary number i this equation has two solutions: x=i and x=-i.\n\nIf we go a step further the equation (x-3)2=-4 has two complex solutions: x=3+2i and x=3-2i.\nx=3+2i and x=3-2i are called each others\' complex conjugate.\n\nNumbers of the form a+bi are called complex numbers.\n\nIn general a+bi and a\xe2\x88\x92bi are each other\'s complex conjugate.\nA Gaussian Integer is a complex number a+bi such that both a and b are integers.\n\nThe regular integers are also Gaussian integers (with b=0).\n\nTo distinguish them from Gaussian integers with b \xe2\x89\xa0 0 we call such integers "rational integers."\n\nA Gaussian integer is called a divisor of a rational integer n if the result is also a Gaussian integer.\n\nIf for example we divide 5 by 1+2i we can simplify  in the following manner:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by the complex conjugate of 1+2i: 1\xe2\x88\x922i.\n\nThe result is \n.\n\nSo 1+2i is a divisor of 5.\n\nNote that 1+i is not a divisor of 5 because .\n\nNote also that if the Gaussian Integer (a+bi) is a divisor of a rational integer n, then its complex conjugate (a\xe2\x88\x92bi) is also a divisor of n.\nIn fact, 5 has six divisors such that the real part is positive: {1, 1 + 2i, 1 \xe2\x88\x92 2i, 2 + i, 2 \xe2\x88\x92 i, 5}.\n\nThe following is a table of all of the divisors for the first five positive rational integers:\n\nn Gaussian integer divisors\nwith positive real partSum s(n) of these\n\ndivisors111\n21, 1+i, 1-i, 25\n31, 34\n41, 1+i, 1-i, 2, 2+2i, 2-2i,413\n51, 1+2i, 1-2i, 2+i, 2-i, 512\nFor divisors with positive real parts, then, we have: .\nFor 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 105, \xe2\x88\x91 s(n)=17924657155.\nWhat is \xe2\x88\x91 s(n) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 108?'
