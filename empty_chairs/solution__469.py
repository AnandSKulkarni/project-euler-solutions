# Problem Statement 
'''
b"In a room N chairs are placed around a round table.\nKnights enter the room one by one and choose at random an available empty chair.\nTo have enough elbow room the knights always leave at least one empty chair between each other.\n\n\nWhen there aren't any suitable chairs left, the fraction C of empty chairs is determined.\nWe also define E(N) as the expected value of C.\nWe can verify that E(4) = 1/2 and E(6) = 5/9.\n\n\nFind E(1018). Give your answer rounded to fourteen decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghijklmn."
