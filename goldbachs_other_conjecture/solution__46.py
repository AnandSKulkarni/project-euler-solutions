# Problem Statement 
'''
b'It was proposed by Christian Goldbach that every odd composite number can be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square.\n9 = 7 + 2\xc3\x9712\n15 = 7 + 2\xc3\x9722\n21 = 3 + 2\xc3\x9732\n25 = 7 + 2\xc3\x9732\n27 = 19 + 2\xc3\x9722\n33 = 31 + 2\xc3\x9712\nIt turns out that the conjecture was false.\nWhat is the smallest odd composite that cannot be written as the sum of a prime and twice a square?'
