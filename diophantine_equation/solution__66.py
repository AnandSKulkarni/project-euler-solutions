# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:\nx2 \xe2\x80\x93 Dy2 = 1\nFor example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 \xe2\x80\x93 13\xc3\x971802 = 1.\nIt can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.\nBy finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:\n32 \xe2\x80\x93 2\xc3\x9722 = 1\n22 \xe2\x80\x93 3\xc3\x9712 = 192 \xe2\x80\x93 5\xc3\x9742 = 1\n52 \xe2\x80\x93 6\xc3\x9722 = 1\n82 \xe2\x80\x93 7\xc3\x9732 = 1\nHence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D \xe2\x89\xa4 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.\nFind the value of D \xe2\x89\xa4 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.'
