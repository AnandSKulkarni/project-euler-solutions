# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Alice and Bob have enjoyed playing Nim every day. However, they finally got bored of playing ordinary three-heap Nim.\nSo, they added an extra rule:\n\n- Must not make two heaps of the same size.\n\nThe triple (a,b,c) indicates the size of three heaps.\nUnder this extra rule, (2,4,5) is one of the losing positions for the next player.\n\nTo illustrate:\n- Alice moves to (2,4,3)\n- Bob   moves to (0,4,3)\n- Alice moves to (0,2,3)\n- Bob   moves to (0,2,1)\n\nUnlike ordinary three-heap Nim, (0,1,2) and its permutations are the end states of this game.\n\nFor an integer N, we define F(N) as the sum of a+b+c for all the losing positions for the next player, with 0 < a < b < c < N.\n\nFor example, F(8) = 42, because there are 4 losing positions for the next player, (1,3,5), (1,4,6), (2,3,6) and (2,4,5).\nWe can also verify that F(128) = 496062.\n\nFind the last 9 digits of F(1018).'
