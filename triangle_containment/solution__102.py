# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 \xe2\x89\xa4 x, y \xe2\x89\xa4 1000, such that a triangle is formed.\nConsider the following two triangles:\nA(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)\nX(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)\nIt can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.\nUsing triangles.txt (right click and \'Save Link/Target As...\'), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.\nNOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.'
