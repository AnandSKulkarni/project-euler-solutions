# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A hexagonal orchard of order n is a triangular lattice made up of points within a regular hexagon with side n. The following is an example of a hexagonal orchard of order 5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighlighted in green are the points which are hidden from the center by a point closer to it. It can be seen that for a hexagonal orchard of order 5, 30 points are hidden from the center.\n\n\n\nLet H(n) be the number of points hidden from the center in a hexagonal orchard of order n.\n\n\n\nH(5) = 30. H(10) = 138. H(1 000) = 1177848.\n\n\n\nFind H(100 000 000).'
