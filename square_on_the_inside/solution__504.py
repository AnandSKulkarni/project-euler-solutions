# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let ABCD be a quadrilateral whose vertices are lattice points lying on the coordinate axes as follows:\n\nA(a, 0), B(0, b), C(\xe2\x88\x92c, 0), D(0, \xe2\x88\x92d), where 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b, c, d \xe2\x89\xa4 m and a, b, c, d, m are integers.\n\nIt can be shown that for m = 4 there are exactly 256 valid ways to construct ABCD. Of these 256 quadrilaterals, 42 of them strictly contain a square number of lattice points.\n\nHow many quadrilaterals ABCD strictly contain a square number of lattice points for m = 100?'
