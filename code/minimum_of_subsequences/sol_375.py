# Problem Statement 
'''
Let Sn be an integer sequence produced with the following pseudo-random number generator:
S0
    = 
    290797 
  Sn+1
    = 
    Sn2 mod 50515093
  


Let A(i, j) be the minimum of the numbers Si, Si+1, ... , Sj for i ≤ j.
Let M(N) = ΣA(i, j) for 1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ N.
We can verify that M(10) = 432256955 and M(10 000) = 3264567774119.


Find M(2 000 000 000).
