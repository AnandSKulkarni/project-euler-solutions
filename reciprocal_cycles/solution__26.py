# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:\n\n1/2=\xc2\xa00.5\n1/3=\xc2\xa00.(3)\n1/4=\xc2\xa00.25\n1/5=\xc2\xa00.2\n1/6=\xc2\xa00.1(6)\n1/7=\xc2\xa00.(142857)\n1/8=\xc2\xa00.125\n1/9=\xc2\xa00.(1)\n1/10=\xc2\xa00.1\n\nWhere 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.\nFind the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.'
