# Problem Statement 
'''
b"We define a simber to be a positive integer in which any odd digit, if present, occurs an odd number of times, and any even digit, if present, occurs an even number of times.\n\nFor example, 141221242 is a 9-digit simber because it has three 1's, four 2's and two 4's. \n\nLet Q(n) be the count of all simbers with at most n digits. \n\nYou are given Q(7) = 287975 and Q(100) mod 1 000 000 123 = 123864868.\n\nFind (\xe2\x88\x911\xe2\x89\xa4u\xe2\x89\xa439 Q(2u)) mod 1 000 000 123."
