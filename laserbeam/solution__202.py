# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Three mirrors are arranged in the shape of an equilateral triangle, with their reflective surfaces pointing inwards. There is an infinitesimal gap at each vertex of the triangle through which a laser beam may pass.\n\nLabel the vertices A, B and C. There are 2 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex C, bounce off 11 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex: one way is shown below; the other is the reverse of that.\n\n\n  \n\nThere are 80840 ways in which a laser beam may enter vertex C, bounce off 1000001 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex.\n\nIn how many ways can a laser beam enter at vertex C, bounce off 12017639147 surfaces, then exit through the same vertex?'
