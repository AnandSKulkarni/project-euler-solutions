# Problem Statement 
'''
b'We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square laminae:\n\n\nWith one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.\nUsing up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be formed?'
