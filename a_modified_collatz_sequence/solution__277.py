# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A modified Collatz sequence of integers is obtained from a starting value a1 in the following way:\n\nan+1 = an/3 if an is divisible by 3. We shall denote this as a large downward step, "D".\n\nan+1 = (4an + 2)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 1. We shall denote this as an upward step, "U".\n\n\nan+1 = (2an - 1)/3 if an divided by 3 gives a remainder of 2. We shall denote this as a small downward step, "d".\n\n\n\n\nThe sequence terminates when some an = 1.\n\n\nGiven any integer, we can list out the sequence of steps.\nFor instance if a1=231, then the sequence {an}={231,77,51,17,11,7,10,14,9,3,1} corresponds to the steps "DdDddUUdDD".\n\n\nOf course, there are other sequences that begin with that same sequence "DdDddUUdDD....".\nFor instance, if a1=1004064, then the sequence is DdDddUUdDDDdUDUUUdDdUUDDDUdDD.\nIn fact, 1004064 is the smallest possible a1 > 106 that begins with the sequence DdDddUUdDD.\n\n\nWhat is the smallest a1 > 1015 that begins with the sequence "UDDDUdddDDUDDddDdDddDDUDDdUUDd"?'
