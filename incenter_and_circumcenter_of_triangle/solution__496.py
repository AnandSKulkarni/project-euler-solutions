# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Given an integer sided triangle ABC:\nLet I be the incenter of ABC.\nLet D be the intersection between the line AI and the circumcircle of ABC (A \xe2\x89\xa0 D).\n\nWe define F(L) as the sum of BC for the triangles ABC that satisfy AC = DI and BC \xe2\x89\xa4 L.\n\nFor example, F(15) = 45 because the triangles ABC with (BC,AC,AB) = (6,4,5), (12,8,10), (12,9,7), (15,9,16) satisfy the conditions.\n\nFind F(109).'
