# Problem Statement 
'''
b'An integer s is called a superinteger of another integer n if the digits of n form a subsequence of the digits of s.\nFor example, 2718281828 is a superinteger of 18828, while 314159 is not a superinteger of 151.\n\n\nLet p(n) be the nth prime number, and let c(n) be the nth composite number. For example, p(1) = 2, p(10) = 29, c(1) = 4 and c(10) = 18.\n{p(i) : i \xe2\x89\xa5 1} = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...}\n{c(i) : i \xe2\x89\xa5 1} = {4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, 18, ...}\n\nLet PD the sequence of the digital roots of {p(i)} (CD is defined similarly for {c(i)}):\nPD = {2, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 8, 1, 5, 2, ...}\nCD = {4, 6, 8, 9, 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, ...}\n\nLet Pn be the integer formed by concatenating the first n elements of PD (Cn is defined similarly for CD).\nP10 = 2357248152\nC10 = 4689135679\n\nLet f(n) be the smallest positive integer that is a common superinteger of Pn and Cn. For example, f(10) = 2357246891352679, and f(100) mod 1\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0007 = 771661825.\n\nFind f(10\xc2\xa0000) mod 1\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0007.'
