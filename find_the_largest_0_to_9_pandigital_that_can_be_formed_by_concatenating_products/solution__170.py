# Solution to Project Euler Problem #170 :: Find the largest 0 to 9 pandigital that can be formed by concatenating products

# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Take the number 6 and multiply it by each of 1273 and 9854:\n\n6 \xc3\x97 1273 =  7638\n6 \xc3\x97 9854 = 59124\n\nBy concatenating these products we get the 1 to 9 pandigital 763859124. We will call 763859124 the "concatenated product of 6 and (1273,9854)". Notice too, that the concatenation of the input numbers, 612739854, is also 1 to 9 pandigital.\n\nThe same can be done for 0 to 9 pandigital numbers.\n\nWhat is the largest 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit concatenated product of an integer with two or more other integers, such that the concatenation of the input numbers is also a 0 to 9 pandigital 10-digit number?'
