# Problem Statement 
'''
In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.

1x
 + 
1y
 = 
1n

For n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:

15
 + 
120
 = 
14
16
 + 
112
 = 
14
18
 + 
18
 = 
14

What is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?
NOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.
