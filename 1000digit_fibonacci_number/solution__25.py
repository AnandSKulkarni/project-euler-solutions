# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:\nFn = Fn\xe2\x88\x921 + Fn\xe2\x88\x922, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.\nHence the first 12 terms will be:\nF1 = 1\nF2 = 1\nF3 = 2\nF4 = 3\nF5 = 5\nF6 = 8\nF7 = 13\nF8 = 21\nF9 = 34\nF10 = 55\nF11 = 89\nF12 = 144\nThe 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.\nWhat is the index of the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?'
