# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Define f(n) as the sum of the factorials of the digits of n. For example, f(342) = 3! + 4! + 2! = 32.\n\nDefine sf(n) as the sum of the digits of f(n). So sf(342) = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nDefine g(i) to be the smallest positive integer n such that sf(n) = i. Though sf(342) is 5, sf(25) is also 5, and it can be verified that g(5) is 25.\n\nDefine sg(i) as the sum of the digits of g(i). So sg(5) = 2 + 5 = 7.\n\nFurther, it can be verified that g(20) is 267 and \xe2\x88\x91\xe2\x80\x89sg(i) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 20 is 156.\n\nWhat is \xe2\x88\x91\xe2\x80\x89sg(i) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 150?'
