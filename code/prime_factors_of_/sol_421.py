# Problem Statement 
'''
Numbers of the form n15+1 are composite for every integer n > 1.
For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be defined as the sum of the distinct prime factors of n15+1 not exceeding m.

E.g. 215+1 = 3×3×11×331.
So s(2,10) = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.

Also 1015+1 = 7×11×13×211×241×2161×9091.
So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,1000) = 483.
Find ∑ s(n,108) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 1011.
