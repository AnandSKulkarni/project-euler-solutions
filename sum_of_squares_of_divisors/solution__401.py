# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The divisors of 6 are 1,2,3 and 6.\nThe sum of the squares of these numbers is 1+4+9+36=50.\n\n\nLet sigma2(n) represent the sum of the squares of the divisors of n.\nThus sigma2(6)=50.\n\nLet SIGMA2 represent the summatory function of sigma2, that is SIGMA2(n)=\xe2\x88\x91sigma2(i) for i=1 to n.\nThe first 6 values of SIGMA2 are: 1,6,16,37,63 and 113.\n\n\nFind SIGMA2(1015) modulo 109.'
