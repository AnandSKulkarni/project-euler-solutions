# Solution to Project Euler Problem #110 :: Diophantine reciprocals II

# Problem Statement 
'''
b'In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.\n\n1x\n + \n1y\n = \n1n\n\nIt can be verified that when n = 1260 there are 113 distinct solutions and this is the least value of n for which the total number of distinct solutions exceeds one hundred.\nWhat is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds four million?\nNOTE: This problem is a much more difficult version of Problem 108 and as it is well beyond the limitations of a brute force approach it requires a clever implementation.'
