# Problem Statement 
'''
b'N\xc3\x97N disks are placed on a square game board. Each disk has a black side and white side.\n\nAt each turn, you may choose a disk and flip all the disks in the same row and the same column as this disk: thus 2\xc3\x97N-1 disks are flipped. The game ends when all disks show their white side. The following example shows a game on a 5\xc3\x975 board.\n\n\n\nIt can be proven that 3 is the minimal number of turns to finish this game.\n\nThe bottom left disk on the N\xc3\x97N board has coordinates (0,0);\nthe bottom right disk has coordinates (N-1,0) and the top left disk has coordinates (0,N-1). \n\nLet CN be the following configuration of a board with N\xc3\x97N disks:\nA disk at (x,y) satisfying , shows its black side; otherwise, it shows its white side. C5 is shown above.\n\nLet T(N) be the minimal number of turns to finish a game starting from configuration CN or 0 if configuration CN is unsolvable.\nWe have shown that T(5)=3. You are also given that T(10)=29 and T(1 000)=395253.\n\nFind .'
