# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Barbara is a mathematician and a basketball player. She has found that the probability of scoring a point when shooting from a distance x is exactly (1\xe2\x80\x89-\xc2\xa0x/q), where q is a real constant greater than 50.\n\nDuring each practice run, she takes shots from distances x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891, x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892, ..., x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8950 and, according to her records, she has precisely a 2\xe2\x80\x89% chance to score a total of exactly 20 points.\n\nFind q and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places.'
