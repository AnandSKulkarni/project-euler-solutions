# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A square piece of paper with integer dimensions N\xc3\x97N is placed with a corner at the origin and two of its sides along the x- and y-axes. Then, we cut it up respecting the following rules:\nWe only make straight cuts between two points lying on different sides of the square, and having integer coordinates.\nTwo cuts cannot cross, but several cuts can meet at the same border point.\nProceed until no more legal cuts can be made.\nCounting any reflections or rotations as distinct, we call C(N) the number of ways to cut an N\xc3\x97N square. For example, C(1)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x892 and C(2)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x8930 (shown below).\n\n\nWhat is C(30) mod 108 ?'
