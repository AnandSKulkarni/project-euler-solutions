# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The number 512 is interesting because it is equal to the sum of its digits raised to some power: 5 + 1 + 2 = 8, and 83 = 512. Another example of a number with this property is 614656 = 284.\nWe shall define an to be the nth term of this sequence and insist that a number must contain at least two digits to have a sum.\nYou are given that a2 = 512 and a10 = 614656.\nFind a30.'
