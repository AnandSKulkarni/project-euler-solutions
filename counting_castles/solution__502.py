# Problem Statement 
'''
b'We define a block to be a rectangle with a height of 1 and an integer-valued length. Let a castle be a configuration of stacked blocks.\n\nGiven a game grid that is w units wide and h units tall, a castle is generated according to the following rules:\n\n\nBlocks can be placed on top of other blocks as long as nothing sticks out past the edges or hangs out over open space.\nAll blocks are aligned/snapped to the grid.\nAny two neighboring blocks on the same row have at least one unit of space between them.\nThe bottom row is occupied by a block of length w.\nThe maximum achieved height of the entire castle is exactly h.\nThe castle is made from an even number of blocks.\nThe following is a sample castle for w=8 and h=5:\n\n\n\nLet F(w,h) represent the number of valid castles, given grid parameters w and h.\n\nFor example, F(4,2) = 10, F(13,10) = 3729050610636, F(10,13) = 37959702514, and F(100,100) mod 1 000 000 007 = 841913936.\n\nFind (F(1012,100) + F(10000,10000) + F(100,1012)) mod 1 000 000 007.'
