# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider all lattice points (a,b,c) with 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 a,b,c \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\n\n\nFrom the origin O(0,0,0) all lines are drawn to the other lattice points.\nLet D(N) be the number of distinct such lines.\n\n\nYou are given that D(1 000 000) = 831909254469114121.\n\nFind D(1010). Give as your answer the first nine digits followed by the last nine digits.'
