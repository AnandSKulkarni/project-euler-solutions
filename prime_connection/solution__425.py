# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Two positive numbers A and B are said to be connected (denoted by "A \xe2\x86\x94 B") if one of these conditions holds:\n(1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 \xe2\x86\x94 173.\n(2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 \xe2\x86\x94 223 and 123 \xe2\x86\x94 23.\n\n\nWe call a prime P a 2\'s relative if there exists a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.\n\n\nFor example, 127 is a 2\'s relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:\n2 \xe2\x86\x94 3 \xe2\x86\x94 13 \xe2\x86\x94 113 \xe2\x86\x94 103 \xe2\x86\x94 107 \xe2\x86\x94 127\nHowever, 11 and 103 are not 2\'s relatives.\n\n\nLet F(N) be the sum of the primes \xe2\x89\xa4 N which are not 2\'s relatives.\nWe can verify that F(103) = 431 and F(104) = 78728.\n\n\nFind F(107).'
