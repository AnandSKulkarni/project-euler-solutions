# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Let's call a lattice point (x, y) inadmissible if x, y and x\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0y are all positive perfect squares.\nFor example, (9, 16) is inadmissible, while (0, 4), (3, 1) and (9, 4) are not.\n\nConsider a path from point (x1, y1) to point (x2, y2) using only unit steps north or east.\nLet's call such a path admissible if none of its intermediate points are inadmissible.\n\nLet P(n) be the number of admissible paths from (0, 0) to (n, n).\nIt can be verified that P(5) = 252, P(16) = 596994440 and P(1000) mod 1\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0007 = 341920854.\n\nFind P(10\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000) mod 1\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0007."
