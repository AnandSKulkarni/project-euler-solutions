# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the fraction, n/d, where n and d are positive integers. If n<d and HCF(n,d)=1, it is called a reduced proper fraction.\nIf we list the set of reduced proper fractions for d \xe2\x89\xa4 8 in ascending order of size, we get:\n1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, 2/5, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8\nIt can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.\nBy listing the set of reduced proper fractions for d \xe2\x89\xa4 1,000,000 in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.'
