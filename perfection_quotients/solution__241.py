# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For a positive integer n, let \xcf\x83(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. \xcf\x83(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.\n\n\nA perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with \xcf\x83(n) = 2n.\n\nLet us define the perfection quotient of a positive integer asp(n)=\xc2\xa0\n\xcf\x83(n)n\n.\nFind the sum of all positive integers n \xe2\x89\xa4 1018 for which p(n) has the form k + 1\xe2\x81\x842, where k is an integer.'
