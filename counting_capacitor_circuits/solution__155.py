# Problem Statement 
'''
b'An electric circuit uses exclusively identical capacitors of the same value C.\n\nThe capacitors can be connected in series or in parallel to form sub-units, which can then be connected in series or in parallel with other capacitors or other sub-units to form larger sub-units, and so on up to a final circuit.\nUsing this simple procedure and up to n identical capacitors, we can make circuits having a range of different total capacitances. For example, using up to n=3 capacitors of 60 F each, we can obtain the following 7 distinct total capacitance values: \n\nIf we denote by D(n) the number of distinct total capacitance values we can obtain when using up to n equal-valued capacitors and the simple procedure described above, we have: D(1)=1, D(2)=3, D(3)=7 ...\nFind D(18).\nReminder : When connecting capacitors C1, C2 etc in parallel, the total capacitance is CT\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa0C1\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0C2\xc2\xa0+...,\n\nwhereas when connecting them in series, the overall capacitance is given by:'
