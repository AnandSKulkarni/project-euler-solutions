# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let An be the smallest positive integer satisfying  An mod pi = i  for all 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 n, where pi is the\ni-th prime.\nFor example A2 = 5, since this is the smallest positive solution of the system of equations \n A2 mod 2 = 1 \n A2 mod 3 = 2\nThe system of equations for A3 adds another constraint. That is, A3 is the smallest positive solution of\n A3 mod 2 = 1 \n A3 mod 3 = 2\n A3 mod 5 = 3\nand hence A3 = 23. Similarly, one gets A4 = 53 and A5 = 1523.\n\n\nLet S(n) be the sum of all primes up to n that divide at least one element in the sequence A.\nFor example, S(50) = 69 = 5 + 23 + 41, since 5 divides A2, 23 divides A3 and 41 divides A10 = 5765999453. No other prime number up to 50 divides an element in A.\n\n\nFind S(300000).'
