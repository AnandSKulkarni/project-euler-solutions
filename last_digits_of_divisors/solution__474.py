# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For a positive integer n and digits d, we define F(n, d) as the number of the divisors of n whose last digits equal d.\nFor example, F(84, 4) = 3. Among the divisors of 84 (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 12, 14, 21, 28, 42, 84), three of them (4, 14, 84) have the last digit 4.\n\n\nWe can also verify that F(12!, 12) = 11 and F(50!, 123) = 17888.\n\n\nFind F(106!, 65432) modulo (1016 + 61).'
