# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Let $\\varphi$ be the golden ratio: $\\varphi=\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}.$\nRemarkably it is possible to write every positive integer as a sum of powers of $\\varphi$ even if we require that every power of $\\varphi$ is used at most once in this sum.\nEven then this representation is not unique.\nWe can make it unique by requiring that no powers with consecutive exponents are used and that the representation is finite.\nE.g: \n$2=\\varphi+\\varphi^{-2}$ and $3=\\varphi^{2}+\\varphi^{-2}$\n\n\nTo represent this sum of powers of $\\varphi$ we use a string of 0's and 1's with a point to indicate where the negative exponents start.\nWe call this the representation in the phigital numberbase.\nSo $1=1_{\\varphi}$, $2=10.01_{\\varphi}$, $3=100.01_{\\varphi}$ and $14=100100.001001_{\\varphi}$. \nThe strings representing 1, 2 and 14 in the phigital number base are palindromic, while the string representing 3 is not. (the phigital point is not the middle character).\n\n\nThe sum of the positive integers not exceeding 1000 whose phigital representation is palindromic is 4345.\n\n\nFind the sum of the positive integers not exceeding $10^{10}$ whose phigital representation is palindromic."
