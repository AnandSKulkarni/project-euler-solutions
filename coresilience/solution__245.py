# Problem Statement 
'''
b"We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4\xe2\x81\x8411.\n\nThe resilience of a number d > 1 is then\n\xcf\x86(d)d \xe2\x88\x92 1\n, where \xcf\x86 is Euler's totient function.\nWe further define the coresilience of a number n > 1 as C(n)=\xc2\xa0\nn \xe2\x88\x92 \xcf\x86(n)n \xe2\x88\x92 1.\nThe coresilience of a prime p is C(p)\n=\xc2\xa0\n1p \xe2\x88\x92 1.\nFind the sum of all composite integers 1 < n \xe2\x89\xa4 2\xc3\x971011, for which C(n) is a unit fraction."
