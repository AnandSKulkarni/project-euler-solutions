# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2\xc3\x971 and 3\xc3\x971 bricks (horizontal\xc3\x97vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".\n\nFor example, the following 9\xc3\x973 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:\n\n\n\n\nThere are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9\xc3\x973 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.\n\nCalculate W(32,10).'
