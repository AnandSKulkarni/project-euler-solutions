# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider all the words which can be formed by selecting letters, in any order, from the phrase:\nthereisasyetinsufficientdataforameaningfulanswer\nSuppose those with 15 letters or less are listed in alphabetical order and numbered sequentially starting at 1.\nThe list would include:\n1 : a\n2 : aa\n3 : aaa\n4 : aaaa\n5 : aaaaa\n6 : aaaaaa\n7 : aaaaaac\n8 : aaaaaacd\n9 : aaaaaacde\n10 : aaaaaacdee\n11 : aaaaaacdeee\n12 : aaaaaacdeeee\n13 : aaaaaacdeeeee\n14 : aaaaaacdeeeeee\n15 : aaaaaacdeeeeeef\n16 : aaaaaacdeeeeeeg\n17 : aaaaaacdeeeeeeh\n...\n28 : aaaaaacdeeeeeey\n29 : aaaaaacdeeeeef\n30 : aaaaaacdeeeeefe\n...\n115246685191495242: euleoywuttttsss\n115246685191495243: euler\n115246685191495244: eulera\n...\n525069350231428029: ywuuttttssssrrrDefine P(w) as the position of the word w.\nDefine W(p) as the word in position p.\nWe can see that P(w) and W(p) are inverses: P(W(p)) = p and W(P(w)) = w.\nExamples:\nW(10) = aaaaaacdee\nP(aaaaaacdee) = 10\nW(115246685191495243) = euler\nP(euler) = 115246685191495243Find W(P(legionary) + P(calorimeters) - P(annihilate) + P(orchestrated) - P(fluttering)).\nGive your answer using lowercase characters (no punctuation or space).'
