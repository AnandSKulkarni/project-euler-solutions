# Problem Statement 
'''
b"The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are\n\n\nn123456789101112131415\xe2\x80\xa6G(n)122334445556666\xe2\x80\xa6\n\nYou are given that G(103) = 86, G(106) = 6137.\nYou are also given that \xce\xa3G(n3) = 153506976 for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n < 103.\n\nFind \xce\xa3G(n3) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n < 106."
