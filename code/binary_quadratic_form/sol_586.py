# Problem Statement 
'''
The number 209 can be expressed as $a^2 + 3ab + b^2$ in two distinct ways:


$ \qquad 209 = 8^2 + 3\cdot 8\cdot 5 + 5^2$ 
$ \qquad 209 = 13^2 + 3\cdot13\cdot 1 + 1^2$


Let $f(n,r)$ be the number of integers $k$ not exceeding $n$ that can be expressed as $k=a^2 + 3ab + b^2$, with $a\gt b>0$ integers, in exactly $r$ different ways.


You are given that $f(10^5, 4) = 237$ and $f(10^8, 6) = 59517$.


Find $f(10^{15}, 40)$.
