# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the isosceles triangle with base length, b = 16, and legs, L = 17.\n\n\nBy using the Pythagorean theorem it can be seen that the height of the triangle, h = \xe2\x88\x9a(172 \xe2\x88\x92 82) = 15, which is one less than the base length.\nWith b = 272 and L = 305, we get h = 273, which is one more than the base length, and this is the second smallest isosceles triangle with the property that h = b \xc2\xb1 1.\nFind \xe2\x88\x91 L for the twelve smallest isosceles triangles for which h = b \xc2\xb1 1 and b, L are positive integers.'
