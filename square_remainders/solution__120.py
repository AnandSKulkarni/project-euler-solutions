# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let r be the remainder when (a\xe2\x88\x921)n + (a+1)n is divided by a2.\nFor example, if a = 7 and n = 3, then r = 42: 63 + 83 = 728 \xe2\x89\xa1 42 mod 49. And as n varies, so too will r, but for a = 7 it turns out that rmax = 42.\nFor 3 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 1000, find \xe2\x88\x91 rmax.'
