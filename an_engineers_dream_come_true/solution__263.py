# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the number 6. The divisors of 6 are: 1,2,3 and 6.\nEvery number from 1 up to and including 6 can be written as a sum of distinct divisors of 6:\n1=1, 2=2, 3=1+2, 4=1+3, 5=2+3, 6=6.\nA number n is called a practical number if every number from 1 up to and including n can be expressed as a sum of distinct divisors of n.\n\n\nA pair of consecutive prime numbers with a difference of six is called a sexy pair (since "sex" is the Latin word for "six"). The first sexy pair is (23, 29).\n\n\nWe may occasionally find a triple-pair, which means three consecutive sexy prime pairs, such that the second member of each pair is the first member of the next pair.\n\n\nWe shall call a number n such that :\n(n-9, n-3), (n-3,n+3), (n+3, n+9) form a triple-pair, and \nthe numbers n-8, n-4, n, n+4 and n+8 are all practical,\n \nan engineers\xe2\x80\x99 paradise.\n\n\nFind the sum of the first four engineers\xe2\x80\x99 paradises.'
