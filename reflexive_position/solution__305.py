# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Let's call S the (infinite) string that is made by concatenating the consecutive positive integers (starting from 1)  written down in base 10. \nThus, S = 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242...\n\n\nIt's easy to see that any number will show up an infinite number of times in S.\n\n\nLet's call f(n) the starting position of the nth occurrence of n in S. \nFor example, f(1)=1, f(5)=81, f(12)=271 and f(7780)=111111365.\n\n\nFind \xe2\x88\x91f(3k) for 1\xe2\x89\xa4k\xe2\x89\xa413."
