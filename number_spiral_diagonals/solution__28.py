# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:\n21 22 23 24 25\n20 \xc2\xa07 \xc2\xa08 \xc2\xa09 10\n19 \xc2\xa06 \xc2\xa01 \xc2\xa02 11\n18 \xc2\xa05 \xc2\xa04 \xc2\xa03 1217 16 15 14 13\nIt can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.\nWhat is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?'
