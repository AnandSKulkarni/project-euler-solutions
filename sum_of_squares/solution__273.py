# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider equations of the form: a2 + b2 = N, 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 b, a, b and N integer.\n\nFor N=65 there are two solutions:\na=1, b=8 and a=4, b=7.\nWe call S(N) the sum of the values of a of all solutions of a2 + b2 = N, 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 b, a, b and N integer.\nThus S(65) = 1 + 4 = 5.\nFind \xe2\x88\x91S(N), for all squarefree N only divisible by primes of the form 4k+1 with 4k+1 < 150.'
