# Problem Statement 
'''
b'When we calculate 8n modulo 11 for n=0 to 9 we get: 1, 8, 9, 6, 4, 10, 3, 2, 5, 7.\nAs we see all possible values from 1 to 10 occur. So 8 is a primitive root of 11.\nBut there is more:\nIf we take a closer look we see:\n1+8=9\n8+9=17\xe2\x89\xa16 mod 11\n9+6=15\xe2\x89\xa14 mod 11\n6+4=10\n4+10=14\xe2\x89\xa13 mod 11\n10+3=13\xe2\x89\xa12 mod 11\n3+2=5\n2+5=7\n5+7=12\xe2\x89\xa11 mod 11.\n\nSo the powers of 8 mod 11 are cyclic with period 10, and 8n + 8n+1 \xe2\x89\xa1 8n+2 (mod 11).\n8 is called a Fibonacci primitive root of 11.\nNot every prime has a Fibonacci primitive root.\nThere are 323 primes less than 10000 with one or more Fibonacci primitive roots and the sum of these primes is 1480491.\nFind the sum of the primes less than 100,000,000 with at least one Fibonacci primitive root.'
