# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For a positive number n, define C(n) as the number of the integers x, for which 1<x<n andx3\xe2\x89\xa11 mod n.\n\n\nWhen n=91, there are 8 possible values for x, namely : 9, 16, 22, 29, 53, 74, 79, 81.\nThus, C(91)=8.\n\nFind the sum of the positive numbers n\xe2\x89\xa41011 for which C(n)=242.'
