# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Define Co(n) to be the maximal possible sum of a set of mutually co-prime elements from {1,\xc2\xa02,\xc2\xa0...,\xc2\xa0n}. For example Co(10) is 30 and hits that maximum on the subset {1,\xc2\xa05,\xc2\xa07,\xc2\xa08,\xc2\xa09}.\n\n\n\nYou are given that Co(30) = 193 and Co(100) = 1356. \n\n\nFind Co(200000).'
