# Problem Statement 
'''
b"A sequence of integers S = {si} is called an n-sequence if it has n elements and each element si satisfies 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 si \xe2\x89\xa4 n. Thus there are nn distinct n-sequences in total.\nFor example, the sequence S = {1, 5, 5, 10, 7, 7, 7, 2, 3, 7} is a 10-sequence.\n\nFor any sequence S, let L(S) be the length of the longest contiguous subsequence of S with the same value.\nFor example, for the given sequence S above, L(S) = 3, because of the three consecutive 7's.\n\nLet f(n) = \xe2\x88\x91 L(S) for all n-sequences S.\n\nFor example, f(3) = 45, f(7) = 1403689 and f(11) = 481496895121.\n\nFind f(7\xc2\xa0500\xc2\xa0000) mod 1\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0009."
