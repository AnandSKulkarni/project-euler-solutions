# Problem Statement 
'''
b'We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry.\nGiven eight tiles it is possible to form a lamina in only one way: 3x3 square with a 1x1 hole in the middle. However, using thirty-two tiles it is possible to form two distinct laminae.\n\n\nIf t represents the number of tiles used, we shall say that t = 8 is type L(1) and t = 32 is type L(2).\nLet N(n) be the number of t \xe2\x89\xa4 1000000 such that t is type L(n); for example, N(15) = 832.\nWhat is \xe2\x88\x91 N(n) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 10?'
