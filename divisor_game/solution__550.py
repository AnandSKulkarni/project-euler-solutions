# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Two players are playing a game. There are k piles of stones.\nWhen it is his turn a player has to choose a pile and replace it by two piles of stones under the following two conditions:\n\n\n Both new piles must have a number of stones more than one and less than the number of stones of the original pile.\n The number of stones of each of the new piles must be a divisor of the number of stones of the original pile.\nThe first player unable to make a valid move loses.\n\nLet f(n,k) be the number of winning positions for the first player, assuming perfect play, when the game is played with k piles each having between 2 and n stones (inclusively).f(10,5)=40085.\n\n\nFind  f(107,1012).Give your answer modulo 987654321.'
