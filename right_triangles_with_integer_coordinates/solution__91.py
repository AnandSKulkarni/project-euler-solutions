# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form \xce\x94OPQ.\n\n\n\n\nThere are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x1, y1, x2, y2 \xe2\x89\xa4 2.\n\n\n\n\nGiven that 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x1, y1, x2, y2 \xe2\x89\xa4 50, how many right triangles can be formed?'
