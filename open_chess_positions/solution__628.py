# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A position in chess is an (orientated) arrangement of chess pieces placed on a chessboard of given size. In the following, we consider all positions in which $n$ pawns are placed on a  $n \\times n$  \nboard in such a way, that there is a single pawn in every row and every column.\n\n\n\nWe call such a position an open position, if a rook, starting at the (empty) lower left corner and using only moves towards the right or upwards, can reach the upper right corner without moving onto any field occupied by a pawn. \n\nLet $f(n)$ be the number of open positions for a $n \\times n$ chessboard.\nFor example, $f(3)=2$, illustrated by the two open positions for a $3  \\times 3$ chessboard below.\n\n\n\n\nYou are also given $f(5)=70$.\nFind $f(10^8)$ modulo $1\\,008\\,691\\,207$.'
