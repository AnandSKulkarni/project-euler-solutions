# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A unitary divisor d of a number n is a divisor of n that has the property gcd(d, n/d) = 1.\nThe unitary divisors of 4! = 24 are 1, 3, 8 and 24.\nThe sum of their squares is 12 + 32 + 82 + 242 = 650.\n\n\nLet S(n) represent the sum of the squares of the unitary divisors of n. Thus S(4!)=650.\n\n\nFind S(100 000 000!) modulo 1 000 000 009.'
