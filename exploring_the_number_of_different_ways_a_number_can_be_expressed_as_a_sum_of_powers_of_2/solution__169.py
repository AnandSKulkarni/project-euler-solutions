# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Define f(0)=1 and f(n) to be the number of different ways n can be expressed as a sum of integer powers of 2 using each power no more than twice.\nFor example, f(10)=5 since there are five different ways to express 10:\n1 + 1 + 8\n1 + 1 + 4 + 41 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4\n2 + 4 + 4\n2 + 8\nWhat is f(1025)?'
