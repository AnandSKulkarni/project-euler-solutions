# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:\nn \xe2\x86\x92 n/2 (n is even)n \xe2\x86\x92 3n + 1 (n is odd)\nUsing the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:\n13 \xe2\x86\x92 40 \xe2\x86\x92 20 \xe2\x86\x92 10 \xe2\x86\x92 5 \xe2\x86\x92 16 \xe2\x86\x92 8 \xe2\x86\x92 4 \xe2\x86\x92 2 \xe2\x86\x92 1\nIt can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains 10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought that all starting numbers finish at 1.\nWhich starting number, under one million, produces the longest chain?\nNOTE: Once the chain starts the terms are allowed to go above one million.'
