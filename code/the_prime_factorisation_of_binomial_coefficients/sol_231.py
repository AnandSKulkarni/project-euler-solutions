# Solution to Project Euler Problem #231 :: The prime factorisation of binomial coefficients

# Problem Statement 
'''
The binomial coefficient 10C3 = 120.
120 = 23 × 3 × 5 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 5, and 2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14.
So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of 10C3 is 14.

Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of 20000000C15000000.
