# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A 4x4 grid is filled with digits d, 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 d \xe2\x89\xa4 9.\n\nIt can be seen that in the grid\n\n\n6 3 3 0\n5 0 4 3\n0 7 1 4\n1 2 4 5\n\nthe sum of each row and each column has the value 12. Moreover the sum of each diagonal is also 12.\n\nIn how many ways can you fill a 4x4 grid with the digits d, 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 d \xe2\x89\xa4 9 so that each row, each column, and both diagonals have the same sum?'
