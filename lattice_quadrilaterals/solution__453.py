# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A simple quadrilateral is a polygon that has four distinct vertices, has no straight angles and does not self-intersect.\n\nLet Q(m, n) be the number of simple quadrilaterals whose vertices are lattice points with coordinates (x,y) satisfying 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 x \xe2\x89\xa4 m and 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 y \xe2\x89\xa4 n.\n\nFor example, Q(2, 2) = 94 as can be seen below:\n\nIt can also be verified that Q(3, 7) = 39590, Q(12, 3) = 309000 and Q(123, 45) = 70542215894646.\n\nFind Q(12345, 6789) mod 135707531.'
