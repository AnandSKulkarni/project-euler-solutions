# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual decimal representation.\nThus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.\n\n\nFor a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k < 10n with the following properties :\nk is divisible by 23 and\nd(k) = 23.\n\nYou are given that S(9) = 263626 and S(42) = 6377168878570056.\n\n\nFind S(1112) and give your answer mod 109.'
