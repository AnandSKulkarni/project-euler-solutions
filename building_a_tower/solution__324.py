# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3\xc3\x973\xc3\x97n tower with blocks of 2\xc3\x971\xc3\x971. You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however, rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.\nFor example (with q = 100000007) :f(2) = 229,f(4) = 117805,f(10) mod q = 96149360,f(103) mod q = 24806056,f(106) mod q = 30808124.\n\nFind f(1010000) mod 100000007."
