# Problem Statement 
'''
b'In a standard 52 card deck of playing cards, a set of 4 cards is a Badugi if it contains 4 cards with no pairs and no two cards of the same suit.\n\nLet f(n) be the number of ways to choose n cards with a 4 card subset that is a Badugi.  For example, there are 2598960 ways to choose five cards from a standard 52 card deck, of which 514800 contain a 4 card subset that is a Badugi, so f(5) = 514800.\n\nFind \xe2\x88\x91f(n)  for 4 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 13.'
