# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A gozinta chain for n is a sequence {1,a,b,...,n} where each element properly divides the next. \nFor example, there are eight distinct gozinta chains for 12: \n{1,12}, {1,2,12}, {1,2,4,12}, {1,2,6,12}, {1,3,12}, {1,3,6,12}, {1,4,12} and {1,6,12}.\n\n\nLet S(n) be the sum of all numbers, k, not exceeding n, which have 252 distinct gozinta chains. \nYou are given S(106)=8462952 and S(1012)=623291998881978.\n\n\nFind S(1036), giving the last nine digits of your answer.'
