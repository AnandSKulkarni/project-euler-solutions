# Solution to Project Euler Problem #216 :: Investigating the primality of numbers of the form 2
# 
# For more information see:

# Problem Statement 
'''
Consider numbers t(n) of the form t(n) = 2n2-1 with n > 1.
The first such numbers are 7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127 and 161.
It turns out that only 49 = 7*7 and 161 = 7*23 are not prime.
For n ≤ 10000 there are 2202 numbers t(n)  that are prime.

How many numbers t(n) are prime for n ≤ 50,000,000 ?
