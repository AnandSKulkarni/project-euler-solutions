# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For a polygon $P$, let $t(P)$ be the number of ways in which $P$ can be tiled using rhombi and squares with edge length 1. Distinct rotations and reflections are counted as separate tilings.\n\n\nFor example, if $O$ is a regular octagon with edge length 1, then $t(O) = 8$. As it happens, all these 8 tilings are rotations of one another:\n\n\n\n\nLet $O_{a,b}$ be the equal-angled convex octagon whose edges alternate in length between $a$ and $b$.\n\nFor example, here is $O_{2,1}$, with one of its tilings:\n\n\n\n\n\nYou are given that $t(O_{1,1})=8$, $t(O_{2,1})=76$ and $t(O_{3,2})=456572$.\n\n\nFind $t(O_{4,2})$.'
