# Problem Statement 
'''
b'For every positive number $n$ we define the function  $streak(n)=k$   as the smallest positive integer $k$ such that $n+k$ is not divisible by $k+1$.\nE.g:\n13 is divisible by 1 \n14 is divisible by 2 \n15 is divisible by 3 \n16 is divisible by 4 \n17 is NOT divisible by 5 \nSo $streak(13) = 4$.  \nSimilarly:\n120 is divisible by 1 \n121 is NOT divisible by 2 \nSo $streak(120) = 1$.\n\n\nDefine $P(s, N)$ to be the number of integers $n$, $1 < n < N$, for which $streak(n) = s$.\nSo $P(3, 14) = 1$ and $P(6, 10^6) = 14286$.\n\n\nFind the sum, as $i$ ranges from 1 to 31, of $P(i, 4^i)$.'
