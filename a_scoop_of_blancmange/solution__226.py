# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The blancmange curve is the set of points (x,y) such that 0\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89x\xe2\x80\x89\xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x891 and  ,where s(x) = the distance from x to the nearest integer.\n\nThe area under the blancmange curve is equal to \xc2\xbd, shown in pink in the diagram below.\n\n\n\n\nLet C be the circle with centre (\xc2\xbc,\xc2\xbd) and radius \xc2\xbc, shown in black in the diagram.\n\nWhat area under the blancmange curve is enclosed by C?Give your answer rounded to eight decimal places in the form 0.abcdefgh'
