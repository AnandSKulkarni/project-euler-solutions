# Problem Statement 
'''
b'There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.\nFor example, when p = 19, 83 + 82\xc3\x9719 = 123.\nWhat is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.\nHow many primes below one million have this remarkable property?'
