# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let x1, x2,..., xn be a sequence of length n such that:\nx1 = 2\nfor all 1 < i \xe2\x89\xa4 n : xi-1 < xi\nfor all i and j with 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 i, j \xe2\x89\xa4 n : (xi) j < (xj + 1)i\n\nThere are only five such sequences of length 2, namely:\n{2,4}, {2,5}, {2,6}, {2,7} and {2,8}.\nThere are 293 such sequences of length 5; three examples are given below:\n{2,5,11,25,55}, {2,6,14,36,88}, {2,8,22,64,181}.\n\n\nLet t(n) denote the number of such sequences of length n.\nYou are given that t(10) = 86195 and t(20) = 5227991891.\n\n\nFind t(1010) and give your answer modulo 109.'
