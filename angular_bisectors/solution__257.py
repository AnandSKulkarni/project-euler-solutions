# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Given is an integer sided triangle ABC with sides a \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4 c. \n(AB = c, BC = a and AC = b).\nThe angular bisectors of the triangle intersect the sides at points E, F and G (see picture below).\n\n\n\n\nThe segments EF, EG and FG partition the triangle ABC into four smaller triangles: AEG, BFE, CGF and EFG.\nIt can be proven that for each of these four triangles the ratio area(ABC)/area(subtriangle) is rational.\nHowever, there exist triangles for which some or all of these ratios are integral.\n\n\nHow many triangles ABC with perimeter\xe2\x89\xa4100,000,000 exist so that the ratio area(ABC)/area(AEG) is integral?'
