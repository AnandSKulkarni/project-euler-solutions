# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let $F(N)$ be the maximum number of lattice points in an axis-aligned $N\\times N$ square that the graph of a single strictly convex increasing function can pass through.\n\n\nYou are given that $F(1) = 2$, $F(3) = 3$,  $F(9) = 6$, $F(11) = 7$, $F(100) = 30$ and $F(50000) = 1898$. \nBelow is the graph of a function reaching the maximum 3 for $N=3$:\n\n\n\n\nFind $F(10^{18})$.'
