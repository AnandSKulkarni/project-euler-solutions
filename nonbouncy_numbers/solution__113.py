# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number; for example, 134468.\nSimilarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number; for example, 66420.\nWe shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number; for example, 155349.\nAs n increases, the proportion of bouncy numbers below n increases such that there are only 12951 numbers below one-million that are not bouncy and only 277032 non-bouncy numbers below 1010.\nHow many numbers below a googol (10100) are not bouncy?'
