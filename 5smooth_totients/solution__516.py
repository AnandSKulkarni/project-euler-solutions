# Problem Statement 
'''
b"5-smooth numbers are numbers whose largest prime factor doesn't exceed 5.\n5-smooth numbers are also called Hamming numbers.\nLet S(L) be the sum of the numbers n not exceeding L such that Euler's totient function \xcf\x86(n) is a Hamming number.\nS(100)=3728.\n\n\nFind S(1012). Give your answer modulo 232."
