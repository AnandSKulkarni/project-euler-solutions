# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the infinite polynomial series AG(x) = xG1 + x2G2 + x3G3 + ..., where Gk is the kth term of the second order recurrence relation Gk = Gk\xe2\x88\x921 + Gk\xe2\x88\x922, G1 = 1 and G2 = 4; that is, 1, 4, 5, 9, 14, 23, ... .\nFor this problem we shall be concerned with values of x for which AG(x) is a positive integer.\nThe corresponding values of x for the first five natural numbers are shown below.\n\nxAG(x)\n(\xe2\x88\x9a5\xe2\x88\x921)/41\n2/52\n(\xe2\x88\x9a22\xe2\x88\x922)/63\n(\xe2\x88\x9a137\xe2\x88\x925)/144\n1/25\n\nWe shall call AG(x) a golden nugget if x is rational, because they become increasingly rarer; for example, the 20th golden nugget is 211345365.\nFind the sum of the first thirty golden nuggets.'
