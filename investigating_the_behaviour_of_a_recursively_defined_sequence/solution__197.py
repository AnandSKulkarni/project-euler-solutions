# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Given is the function f(x) = \xe2\x8c\x8a230.403243784-x2\xe2\x8c\x8b \xc3\x97 10-9 ( \xe2\x8c\x8a \xe2\x8c\x8b is the floor-function),\nthe sequence un is defined by u0 = -1 and un+1 = f(un).\n\nFind un + un+1 for n = 1012.\nGive your answer with 9 digits after the decimal point.'
