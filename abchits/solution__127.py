# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of distinct prime factors of n. For example, 504 = 23 \xc3\x97 32 \xc3\x97 7, so rad(504) = 2 \xc3\x97 3 \xc3\x97 7 = 42.\nWe shall define the triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an abc-hit if:\nGCD(a, b) = GCD(a, c) = GCD(b, c) = 1\na < b\na + b = c\nrad(abc) < c\nFor example, (5, 27, 32) is an abc-hit, because:\nGCD(5, 27) = GCD(5, 32) = GCD(27, 32) = 1\n5 < 27\n5 + 27 = 32\nrad(4320) = 30 < 32\nIt turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one abc-hits for c < 1000, with \xe2\x88\x91c = 12523.\nFind \xe2\x88\x91c for c < 120000.'
