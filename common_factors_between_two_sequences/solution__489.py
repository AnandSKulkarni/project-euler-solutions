# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let G(a, b) be the smallest non-negative integer n for which gcd(n3 + b, (n + a)3 + b) is maximized.\nFor example, G(1, 1) = 5 because gcd(n3 + 1, (n + 1)3 + 1) reaches its maximum value of 7 for n = 5, and is smaller for 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 n < 5.\nLet H(m, n) = \xce\xa3 G(a, b) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a \xe2\x89\xa4 m, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 b \xe2\x89\xa4 n.\nYou are given H(5, 5) = 128878 and H(10, 10) = 32936544.\nFind H(18, 1900).'
