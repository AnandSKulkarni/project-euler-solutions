# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The coefficients in the expansion of $(x+1)^k$ are called binomial coefficients.\nAnaloguously the coefficients in the expansion of $(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^k$ are called quintinomial coefficients. (quintus= Latin for fifth).\n\n\nConsider the expansion of $(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^3$:\n$x^{12}+3x^{11}+6x^{10}+10x^9+15x^8+18x^7+19x^6+18x^5+15x^4+10x^3+6x^2+3x+1$\nAs we can see 7 out of the 13 quintinomial coefficients for $k=3$ are odd.\n\n\nLet $Q(k)$ be the number of odd coefficients in the expansion of $(x^4+x^3+x^2+x+1)^k$.\nSo $Q(3)=7$.\n\n\nYou are given $Q(10)=17$ and $Q(100)=35$.\n\nFind  $\\sum_{k=1}^{18}Q(10^k) $.'
