# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:\n1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145\nPerhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:\n169 \xe2\x86\x92 363601 \xe2\x86\x92 1454 \xe2\x86\x92 169\n871 \xe2\x86\x92 45361 \xe2\x86\x92 871\n872 \xe2\x86\x92 45362 \xe2\x86\x92 872\nIt is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,\n69 \xe2\x86\x92 363600 \xe2\x86\x92 1454 \xe2\x86\x92 169 \xe2\x86\x92 363601 (\xe2\x86\x92 1454)\n78 \xe2\x86\x92 45360 \xe2\x86\x92 871 \xe2\x86\x92 45361 (\xe2\x86\x92 871)\n540 \xe2\x86\x92 145 (\xe2\x86\x92 145)\nStarting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.\nHow many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?'
