b"Let's call two numbers  friend numbers if their representation in base 10 has at least one common digit. E.g. 1123 and 3981 are friend numbers. \n\n\nLet $f(n)$ be the number of pairs $(p,q)$ with $1\\le p \\lt q \\lt n$ such that $p$ and $q$ are friend numbers.\n$f(100)=1539$.\n\n\nFind $f(10^{18})$ mod $1000267129$."
