# Problem Statement 
'''
b'An equilateral triangle with integer side length $n \\ge 3$ is divided into $n^2$ equilateral triangles with side length 1 as shown in the diagram below.\nThe vertices of these triangles constitute a triangular lattice with $\\frac{(n+1)(n+2)} 2$ lattice points.\nLet $H(n)$ be the number of all regular hexagons that can be found by connecting 6 of these points. \n\n\n\n\nFor example, $H(3)=1$, $H(6)=12$ and $H(20)=966$.\n\nFind $\\displaystyle \\sum_{n=3}^{12345} H(n)$.'
