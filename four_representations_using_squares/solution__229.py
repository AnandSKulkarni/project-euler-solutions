# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the number 3600. It is very special, because\n\n3600 = 482 + \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 \xc2\xa0362\n3600 = 202 + 2\xc3\x97402\n3600 = 302 + 3\xc3\x97302\n3600 = 452 + 7\xc3\x97152\n\nSimilarly, we find that 88201 = 992 + 2802 = 2872 + 2\xc3\x97542 = 2832 + 3\xc3\x97522 = 1972 + 7\xc3\x97842.\n\nIn 1747, Euler proved which numbers are representable as a sum of two squares.\nWe are interested in the numbers n which admit representations of all of the following four types:\n\nn = a12 + \xc2\xa0 b12n = a22 + 2 b22n = a32 + 3 b32n = a72 + 7 b72,\n\nwhere the ak and bk are positive integers.\n\nThere are 75373 such numbers that do not exceed 107.\n\nHow many such numbers are there that do not exceed 2\xc3\x97109?'
