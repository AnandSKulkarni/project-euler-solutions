# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2 \xe2\x88\x92 y2 \xe2\x88\x92 z2 = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:\n132 \xe2\x88\x92 102 \xe2\x88\x92 72 = 20\nIn fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.\nHow many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?'
