# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the triangle with sides \xe2\x88\x9a5, \xe2\x88\x9a65 and \xe2\x88\x9a68.\nIt can be shown that this triangle has area 9.\n\nS(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides \xe2\x88\x9a(1+b2), \xe2\x88\x9a(1+c2) and \xe2\x88\x9a(b2+c2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not exceeding n.\n\nThe example triangle has b=2 and c=8.\n\nS(106)=18018206.\n\nFind S(1010).'
