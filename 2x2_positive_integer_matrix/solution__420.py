# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A positive integer matrix is a matrix whose elements are all positive integers.\nSome positive integer matrices can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways. Here is an example:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe define F(N) as the number of the 2x2 positive integer matrices which have a trace less than N and which can be expressed as a square of a positive integer matrix in two different ways.\nWe can verify that F(50) = 7 and F(1000) = 1019.\n\n\n\nFind F(107).'
