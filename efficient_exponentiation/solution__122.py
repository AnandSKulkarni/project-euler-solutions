# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The most naive way of computing n15 requires fourteen multiplications:\nn \xc3\x97 n \xc3\x97 ... \xc3\x97 n = n15\nBut using a "binary" method you can compute it in six multiplications:\nn \xc3\x97 n = n2n2 \xc3\x97 n2 = n4n4 \xc3\x97 n4 = n8n8 \xc3\x97 n4 = n12n12 \xc3\x97 n2 = n14n14 \xc3\x97 n = n15\nHowever it is yet possible to compute it in only five multiplications:\nn \xc3\x97 n = n2n2 \xc3\x97 n = n3n3 \xc3\x97 n3 = n6n6 \xc3\x97 n6 = n12n12 \xc3\x97 n3 = n15\nWe shall define m(k) to be the minimum number of multiplications to compute nk; for example m(15) = 5.\nFor 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 200, find \xe2\x88\x91 m(k).'
