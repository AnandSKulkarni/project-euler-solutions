# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.\nFor example,\n44 \xe2\x86\x92 32 \xe2\x86\x92 13 \xe2\x86\x92 10 \xe2\x86\x92 1 \xe2\x86\x92 1\n85 \xe2\x86\x92 89 \xe2\x86\x92 145 \xe2\x86\x92 42 \xe2\x86\x92 20 \xe2\x86\x92 4 \xe2\x86\x92 16 \xe2\x86\x92 37 \xe2\x86\x92 58 \xe2\x86\x92 89\nTherefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.\nHow many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?'
