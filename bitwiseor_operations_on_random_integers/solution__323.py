# Solution to Project Euler Problem #323 :: Bitwise-OR operations on random integers

# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let y0, y1, y2,... be a sequence of random unsigned 32 bit integers\n(i.e. 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 yi < 232, every value equally likely).\nFor the sequence xi the following recursion is given:x0 = 0 and\nxi = xi-1| yi-1, for i > 0. ( | is the bitwise-OR operator)\nIt can be seen that eventually there will be an index N such that xi = 232 -1 (a bit-pattern of all ones) for all i \xe2\x89\xa5 N.\n\nFind the expected value of N. \nGive your answer rounded to 10 digits after the decimal point.'
