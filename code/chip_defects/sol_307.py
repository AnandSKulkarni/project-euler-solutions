# Solution to Project Euler Problem #307 :: Chip Defects

# Problem Statement 
'''
k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each defect is independent of the other defects).


Let p(k,n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3 defects.
For instance p(3,7) â‰ˆ 0.0204081633.


Find p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij
