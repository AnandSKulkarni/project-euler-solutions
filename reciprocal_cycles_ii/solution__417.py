# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:\n\n1/2=\xc2\xa00.5\n1/3=\xc2\xa00.(3)\n1/4=\xc2\xa00.25\n1/5=\xc2\xa00.2\n1/6=\xc2\xa00.1(6)\n1/7=\xc2\xa00.(142857)\n1/8=\xc2\xa00.125\n1/9=\xc2\xa00.(1)\n1/10=\xc2\xa00.1\n\nWhere 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.\n\nUnit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or 5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.\nWe define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0. \n\n\nLet L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n.\nYou are given that \xe2\x88\x91L(n) for 3 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.\n\n\nFind \xe2\x88\x91L(n) for 3 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100 000 000'
