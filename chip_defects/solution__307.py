# Problem Statement 
'''
b'k defects are randomly distributed amongst n integrated-circuit chips produced by a factory (any number of defects may be found on a chip and each defect is independent of the other defects).\n\n\nLet p(k,n) represent the probability that there is a chip with at least 3 defects.\nFor instance p(3,7) \xe2\x89\x88 0.0204081633.\n\n\nFind p(20 000, 1 000 000) and give your answer rounded to 10 decimal places in the form 0.abcdefghij'
