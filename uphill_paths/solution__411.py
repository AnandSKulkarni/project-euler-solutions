# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let n be a positive integer. Suppose there are stations at the coordinates (x, y) = (2i mod n, 3i mod n) for 0 \xe2\x89\xa4 i \xe2\x89\xa4 2n. We will consider stations with the same coordinates as the same station.\n\nWe wish to form a path from (0, 0) to (n, n) such that the x and y coordinates never decrease.\nLet S(n) be the maximum number of stations such a path can pass through.\n\nFor example, if n = 22, there are 11 distinct stations, and a valid path can pass through at most 5 stations. Therefore, S(22) = 5.\nThe case is illustrated below, with an example of an optimal path:\n\n\n\nIt can also be verified that S(123) = 14 and S(10000) = 48.\n\nFind \xe2\x88\x91 S(k5) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 30.'
