# Problem Statement 
'''
A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

1/2= 0.5
1/3= 0.(3)
1/4= 0.25
1/5= 0.2
1/6= 0.1(6)
1/7= 0.(142857)
1/8= 0.125
1/9= 0.(1)
1/10= 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or 5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0. 


Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n.
You are given that ∑L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.


Find ∑L(n) for 3 ≤ n ≤ 100 000 000
