# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees a 60-degree triangle.\nLet r be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.\nThere are 1234 60-degree triangles for which r \xe2\x89\xa4 100.\nLet T(n) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which r \xe2\x89\xa4 n, so\n T(100) = 1234,\xc2\xa0 T(1000) = 22767, and\xc2\xa0 T(10000) = 359912.\n\nFind T(1053779)."
