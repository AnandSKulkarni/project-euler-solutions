# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k.\nFor example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11\xc3\x9741\xc3\x97271\xc3\x979091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414.\nFind the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(109).'
