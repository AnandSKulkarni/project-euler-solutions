# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A firecracker explodes at a height of 100 m above level ground. It breaks into a large number of very small fragments, which move in every direction; all of them have the same initial velocity of 20 m/s.\n\n\nWe assume that the fragments move without air resistance, in a uniform gravitational field with g=9.81 m/s2.\n\n\nFind the volume (in m3) of the region through which the fragments move before reaching the ground. \nGive your answer rounded to four decimal places.'
