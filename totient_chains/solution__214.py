# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Let \xcf\x86 be Euler's totient function, i.e. for a natural number n,\n\xcf\x86(n) is the number of k, 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 k \xe2\x89\xa4 n, for which gcd(k,n) = 1.\n\nBy iterating \xcf\x86, each positive integer generates a decreasing chain of numbers ending in 1.\nE.g. if we start with 5 the sequence 5,4,2,1 is generated.\nHere is a listing of all chains with length 4:\n\n\n5,4,2,1\n7,6,2,1\n8,4,2,1\n9,6,2,1\n10,4,2,1\n12,4,2,1\n14,6,2,1\n18,6,2,1\n\nOnly two of these chains start with a prime, their sum is 12.\n\nWhat is the sum of all primes less than 40000000 which generate a chain of length 25?"
