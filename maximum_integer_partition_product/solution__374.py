# Problem Statement 
'''
b'An integer partition of a number n is a way of writing n as a sum of positive integers.\n\nPartitions that differ only in the order of their summands are considered the same.\nA partition of n into distinct parts is a partition of n in which every part occurs at most once.\n\nThe partitions of 5 into distinct parts are:\n5, 4+1 and 3+2.\n\nLet f(n) be the maximum product of the parts of any such partition of n into distinct parts and let m(n) be the number of elements of any such partition of n with that product.\n\nSo f(5)=6 and m(5)=2.\n\nFor n=10 the partition with the largest product is 10=2+3+5, which gives f(10)=30 and m(10)=3.\nAnd their product, f(10)\xc2\xb7m(10) = 30\xc2\xb73 = 90\n\nIt can be verified that\n\xe2\x88\x91f(n)\xc2\xb7m(n) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 100 = 1683550844462.\n\nFind \xe2\x88\x91f(n)\xc2\xb7m(n) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 1014.\nGive your answer modulo 982451653, the 50 millionth prime.'
