# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Consider a honey bee's honeycomb where each cell is a perfect regular hexagon with side length 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne particular cell is occupied by the queen bee.\nFor a positive real number L, let B(L) count the cells with distance L from the queen bee cell (all distances are measured from centre to centre); you may assume that the honeycomb is large enough to accommodate for any distance we wish to consider. \nFor example, B(\xe2\x88\x9a3) = 6, B(\xe2\x88\x9a21) = 12 and B(111 111 111) = 54.\n\nFind the number of L \xe2\x89\xa4 5\xc2\xb71011 such that B(L) = 450."
