# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A composite is a number containing at least two prime factors. For example, 15 = 3 \xc3\x97 5; 9 = 3 \xc3\x97 3; 12 = 2 \xc3\x97 2 \xc3\x97 3.\n\nThere are ten composites below thirty containing precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors:\n4, 6, 9, 10, 14, 15, 21, 22, 25, 26.\n\nHow many composite integers, n < 108, have precisely two, not necessarily distinct, prime factors?'
