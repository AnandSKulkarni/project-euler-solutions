# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider numbers t(n) of the form t(n) = 2n2-1 with n > 1.\nThe first such numbers are 7, 17, 31, 49, 71, 97, 127 and 161.\nIt turns out that only 49 = 7*7 and 161 = 7*23 are not prime.\nFor n \xe2\x89\xa4 10000 there are 2202 numbers t(n)  that are prime.\n\nHow many numbers t(n) are prime for n \xe2\x89\xa4 50,000,000 ?'
