# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the numbers 15, 16 and 18:\n$15=3\\times 5$ and $3+5=8$.\n$16 = 2\\times 2\\times 2\\times 2$ and $2+2+2+2=8$.\n$18 = 2\\times 3\\times 3$ and $2+3+3=8$. \n\n15, 16 and 18 are the only numbers that have 8 as sum of the prime factors (counted with multiplicity).\n\nWe define $S(k)$ to be the sum of all numbers $n$ where the sum of the prime factors (with multiplicity)  of $n$ is $k$.\nHence $S(8) = 15+16+18 = 49$.\nOther examples: $S(1) = 0$, $S(2) = 2$, $S(3) = 3$, $S(5) = 5 + 6 = 11$.\n\nThe Fibonacci sequence is $F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, F_3 = 2, F_4 = 3, F_5 = 5$, ....\nFind the last nine digits of $\\displaystyle\\sum_{k=2}^{24}{S(F_k)}$.'
