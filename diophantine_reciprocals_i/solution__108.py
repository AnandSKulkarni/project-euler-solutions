# Problem Statement 
'''
b'In the following equation x, y, and n are positive integers.\n\n1x\n + \n1y\n = \n1n\n\nFor n = 4 there are exactly three distinct solutions:\n\n15\n + \n120\n = \n14\n16\n + \n112\n = \n14\n18\n + \n18\n = \n14\n\nWhat is the least value of n for which the number of distinct solutions exceeds one-thousand?\nNOTE: This problem is an easier version of Problem 110; it is strongly advised that you solve this one first.'
