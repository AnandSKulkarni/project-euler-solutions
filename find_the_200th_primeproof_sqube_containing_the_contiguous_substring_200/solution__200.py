# Solution to Project Euler Problem #200 :: Find the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200"

# Problem Statement 
'''
b'We shall define a sqube to be a number of the form, p2q3, where p and q are distinct primes.\nFor example, 200 = 5223 or 120072949 = 232613.\n\nThe first five squbes are 72, 108, 200, 392, and 500.\n\nInterestingly, 200 is also the first number for which you cannot change any single digit to make a prime; we shall call such numbers, prime-proof. The next prime-proof sqube which contains the contiguous sub-string "200" is 1992008.\n\nFind the 200th prime-proof sqube containing the contiguous sub-string "200".'
