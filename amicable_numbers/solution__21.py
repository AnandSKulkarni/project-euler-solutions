# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let d(n) be defined as the sum of proper divisors of n (numbers less than n which divide evenly into n).\nIf d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a \xe2\x89\xa0 b, then a and b are an amicable pair and each of a and b are called amicable numbers.\nFor example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55 and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71 and 142; so d(284) = 220.\nEvaluate the sum of all the amicable numbers under 10000.'
