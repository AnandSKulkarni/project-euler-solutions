# Problem Statement 
'''
b'We want to tile a board of length n and height 1 completely, with either 1 \xc3\x97 2 blocks or 1 \xc3\x97 1 blocks with a single decimal digit on top:\n\nFor example, here are some of the ways to tile a board of length n = 8:\n\nLet T(n) be the number of ways to tile a board of length n as described above.\n\nFor example, T(1) = 10 and T(2) = 101.\n\nLet S(L) be the triple sum \xe2\x88\x91a,b,c gcd(T(ca), T(cb)) for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 a, b, c \xe2\x89\xa4 L.\nFor example:\nS(2) = 10444\nS(3) = 1292115238446807016106539989\nS(4) mod 987\xc2\xa0898\xc2\xa0789 = 670616280.\n\nFind S(2000) mod 987\xc2\xa0898\xc2\xa0789.'
