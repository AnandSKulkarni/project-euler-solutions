# Problem Statement 
'''
b'We shall define a pythagorean polygon  to be a convex polygon with the following properties:there are at least three vertices,\nno three vertices are aligned,\neach vertex has integer coordinates,\neach edge has integer length.For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is \xe2\x89\xa4\xe2\x80\x89n.\nPythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.\n\nYou are given that P(4)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x891, P(30)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x893655 and P(60)\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x89891045.\nFind P(120).'
