# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Define $F(n)$ to be the number of integers $x\xe2\x89\xa4n$ that can be written in the form $x=a^2b^3$, where $a$ and $b$ are integers not necessarily different and both greater than 1.\n\nFor example, $32=2^2\\times 2^3$  and $72=3^2\\times 2^3$ are the only two integers less than 100 that can be written in this form. Hence, $F(100)=2$.\n\n\nFurther you are given $F(2\\times 10^4)=130$ and $F(3\\times 10^6)=2014$.\n\n\nFind $F(9\\times 10^{18})$.'
