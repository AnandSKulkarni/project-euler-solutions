# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Consider the number 142857. We can right-rotate this number by moving the last digit (7) to the front of it, giving us 714285.\nIt can be verified that 714285=5\xc3\x97142857.\nThis demonstrates an unusual property of 142857: it is a divisor of its right-rotation.\nFind the last 5 digits of the sum of all integers n, 10 < n < 10100, that have this property.'
