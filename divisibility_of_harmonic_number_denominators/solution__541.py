# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The nthharmonic number Hn is defined as the sum of the multiplicative inverses of the first n positive integers, and can be written as a reduced fraction an/bn.\n$H_n = \\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac 1 k = \\frac {a_n} {b_n}$, with $\\text {gcd}(a_n, b_n)=1$.\n\nLet M(p) be the largest value of n such that bn is not divisible by p.\n\nFor example, M(3) = 68 because $H_{68} = \\frac {a_{68}} {b_{68}} = \\frac {14094018321907827923954201611} {2933773379069966367528193600}$, b68=2933773379069966367528193600 is not divisible by 3, but all larger harmonic numbers have denominators divisible by 3.\n\nYou are given M(7) = 719102.\n\nFind M(137).'
