# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A list of size n is a sequence of n natural numbers. Examples are (2,4,6), (2,6,4), (10,6,15,6), and (11).\n\nThe greatest common divisor, or gcd, of a list is the largest natural number that divides all entries of the list. Examples: gcd(2,6,4) = 2, gcd(10,6,15,6) = 1 and gcd(11) = 11.\n\nThe least common multiple, or lcm, of a list is the smallest natural number divisible by each entry of the list. Examples: lcm(2,6,4) = 12, lcm(10,6,15,6) = 30 and lcm(11) = 11.\n\nLet f(G, L, N) be the number of lists of size N with gcd \xe2\x89\xa5 G and lcm \xe2\x89\xa4 L. For example:\n\nf(10, 100, 1) = 91.\nf(10, 100, 2) = 327.\nf(10, 100, 3) = 1135.\nf(10, 100, 1000) mod 1014 = 3286053.\n\nFind f(106, 1012, 1018) mod 1014.'
