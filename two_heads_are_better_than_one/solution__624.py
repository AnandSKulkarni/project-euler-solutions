# Problem Statement 
'''
b'An unbiased coin is tossed repeatedly until two consecutive heads are obtained. Suppose these occur on the $(M-1)$th and $M$th toss.\nLet $P(n)$ be the probability that $M$ is divisible by $n$. For example, the outcomes HH, HTHH, and THTTHH all count towards $P(2)$, but THH and HTTHH do not.\n\nYou are given that $P(2) =\\frac 3 5$ and $P(3)=\\frac 9  {31}$. Indeed, it can be shown that $P(n)$ is always a rational number.\n\nFor a prime $p$ and a fully reduced fraction $\\frac a b$, define $Q(\\frac a b,p)$ to be the smallest positive $q$ for which $a \\equiv b q \\pmod{p}$.\nFor example $Q(P(2), 109) = Q(\\frac 3 5, 109) = 66$, because $5 \\cdot 66 = 330 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{109}$ and 66 is the smallest positive such number.\nSimilarly $Q(P(3),109) = 46$.\n\nFind $Q(P(10^{18}),1\\,000\\,000\\,009)$.'
