# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The minimum number of cubes to cover every visible face on a cuboid measuring 3\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa01 is twenty-two.\n\n\nIf we then add a second layer to this solid it would require forty-six cubes to cover every visible face, the third layer would require seventy-eight cubes, and the fourth layer would require one-hundred and eighteen cubes to cover every visible face.\nHowever, the first layer on a cuboid measuring 5\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa01 also requires twenty-two cubes; similarly the first layer on cuboids measuring 5\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa03\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa01, 7\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa02\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa01, and 11\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa01\xc2\xa0x\xc2\xa01 all contain forty-six cubes.\nWe shall define C(n) to represent the number of cuboids that contain n cubes in one of its layers. So C(22) = 2, C(46) = 4, C(78) = 5, and C(118) = 8.\nIt turns out that 154 is the least value of n for which C(n) = 10.\nFind the least value of n for which C(n) = 1000.'
