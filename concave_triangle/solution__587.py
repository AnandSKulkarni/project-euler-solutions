# Problem Statement 
'''
b'A square is drawn around a circle as shown in the diagram below on the left.\nWe shall call the blue shaded region the L-section.\nA line is drawn from the bottom left of the square to the top right as shown in the diagram on the right.\nWe shall call the orange shaded region a concave triangle.\n\n\n\n\nIt should be clear that the concave triangle occupies exactly half of the L-section.\n\n\n\nTwo circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around both circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right as shown in the diagram below.\n\n\n\n\nThis time the concave triangle occupies approximately 36.46% of the L-section.\n\n\nIf n circles are placed next to each other horizontally, a rectangle is drawn around the n circles, and a line is drawn from the bottom left to the top right, then it can be shown that the least value of n for which the concave triangle occupies less than 10% of the L-section is n\xc2\xa0=\xc2\xa015.\n\n\nWhat is the least value of n for which the concave triangle occupies less than 0.1% of the L-section?'
