# Problem Statement 
'''
b'An integer is called eleven-free if its decimal expansion does not contain any substring representing a power of 11 except 1.\n\nFor example, 2404 and 13431 are eleven-free, while 911 and 4121331 are not.\n\nLet E(n) be the nth positive eleven-free integer. For example, E(3) = 3, E(200) = 213 and E(500\xc2\xa0000) = 531563.\n\nFind E(1018).'
