# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let n be a positive integer. Consider nim positions where:There are n non-empty piles.\nEach pile has size less than 2n.\nNo two piles have the same size.\nLet W(n) be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the above\nconditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2) = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360 and W(100) mod 1\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0007 = 384777056.\n\nFind W(10\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000) mod 1\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0000\xc2\xa0007.'
