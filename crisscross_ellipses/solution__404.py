# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Ea is an ellipse with an equation of the form x2 + 4y2 = 4a2.\nEa' is the rotated image of Ea by \xce\xb8 degrees counterclockwise around the origin O(0, 0) for 0\xc2\xb0 < \xce\xb8 < 90\xc2\xb0.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nb is the distance to the origin of the two intersection points closest to the origin and c is the distance of the two other intersection points.\nWe call an ordered triplet (a, b, c) a canonical ellipsoidal triplet if a, b and c are positive integers.\nFor example, (209, 247, 286) is a canonical ellipsoidal triplet.\n\n\n\nLet C(N) be the number of distinct canonical ellipsoidal triplets (a, b, c) for a \xe2\x89\xa4 N.\nIt can be verified that C(103) = 7, C(104) = 106 and C(106) = 11845.\n\n\n\nFind C(1017)."
