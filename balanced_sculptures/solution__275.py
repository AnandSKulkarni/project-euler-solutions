# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let us define a balanced sculpture of order n as follows:\nA polyomino made up of n+1 tiles known as the blocks (n tiles) and the plinth (remaining tile);\nthe plinth has its centre at position (x\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890, y\xe2\x80\x89=\xe2\x80\x890);\nthe blocks have y-coordinates greater than zero (so the plinth is the unique lowest tile);\nthe centre of mass of all the blocks, combined, has x-coordinate equal to zero.\nWhen counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply reflections about the y-axis, are not counted as distinct. For example, the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair of mirror images (about the y-axis) is counted as one sculpture:\n\n\nThere are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.How many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?'
