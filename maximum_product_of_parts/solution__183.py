# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let N be a positive integer and let N be split into k equal parts, r = N/k, so that N = r + r + ... + r.\nLet P be the product of these parts, P = r \xc3\x97 r \xc3\x97 ... \xc3\x97 r = rk.\n\nFor example, if 11 is split into five equal parts, 11 = 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2 + 2.2, then P = 2.25 = 51.53632.\n\nLet M(N) = Pmax for a given value of N.\n\nIt turns out that the maximum for N = 11 is found by splitting eleven into four equal parts which leads to Pmax = (11/4)4; that is, M(11) = 14641/256 = 57.19140625, which is a terminating decimal.\n\nHowever, for N = 8 the maximum is achieved by splitting it into three equal parts, so M(8) = 512/27, which is a non-terminating decimal.\n\nLet D(N) = N if M(N) is a non-terminating decimal and D(N) = -N if M(N) is a terminating decimal.\n\nFor example, \xce\xa3D(N) for 5 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 100 is 2438.\n\nFind \xce\xa3D(N) for 5 \xe2\x89\xa4 N \xe2\x89\xa4 10000.'
