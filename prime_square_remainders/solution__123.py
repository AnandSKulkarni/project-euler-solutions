# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let pn be the nth prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let r be the remainder when (pn\xe2\x88\x921)n + (pn+1)n is divided by pn2.\nFor example, when n = 3, p3 = 5, and 43 + 63 = 280 \xe2\x89\xa1 5 mod 25.\nThe least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 109 is 7037.\nFind the least value of n for which the remainder first exceeds 1010.'
