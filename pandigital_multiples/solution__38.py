# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Take the number 192 and multiply it by each of 1, 2, and 3:\n192 \xc3\x97 1 = 192\n192 \xc3\x97 2 = 384\n192 \xc3\x97 3 = 576\nBy concatenating each product we get the 1 to 9 pandigital, 192384576. We will call 192384576 the concatenated product of 192 and (1,2,3)\nThe same can be achieved by starting with 9 and multiplying by 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, giving the pandigital, 918273645, which is the concatenated product of 9 and (1,2,3,4,5).\nWhat is the largest 1 to 9 pandigital 9-digit number that can be formed as the concatenated product of an integer with (1,2, ... , n) where n > 1?'
