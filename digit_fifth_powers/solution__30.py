# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of fourth powers of their digits:\n1634 = 14 + 64 + 34 + 44\n8208 = 84 + 24 + 04 + 84\n9474 = 94 + 44 + 74 + 44\nAs 1 = 14 is not a sum it is not included.\nThe sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.\nFind the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers of their digits.'
