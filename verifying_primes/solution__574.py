# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let $q$ be a prime and $A \\ge B >0$ be two integers with the following properties:\n $A$ and $B$ have no prime factor in common, that is $\\text{gcd}(A,B)=1$.\n The product $AB$ is divisible by every prime less than q.\n\nIt can be shown that, given these conditions, any sum $A+B<q^2$ and any difference $1<A-B<q^2$ has to be a prime number. Thus you can verify that a number $p$ is prime by showing that either $p=A+B<q^2$ or $p=A-B<q^2$ for some $A,B,q$ fulfilling the conditions listed above.\n\nLet $V(p)$ be the smallest possible value of $A$ in any sum $p=A+B$ and any difference $p=A-B$, that verifies $p$ being prime. Examples:\n$V(2)=1$, since $2=1+1< 2^2$. \n$V(37)=22$, since $37=22+15=2 \\cdot 11+3 \\cdot 5< 7^2$ is the associated sum with the smallest possible $A$.\n$V(151)=165$ since $151=165-14=3 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 11 - 2 \\cdot 7<13^2$ is the associated difference with the smallest possible $A$. \n\nLet $S(n)$ be the sum of $V(p)$ for all primes $p<n$. For example, $S(10)=10$ and $S(200)=7177$.\n\nFind $S(3800)$.'
