# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Many numbers can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube. Some of them in more than one way.\n\nConsider the palindromic numbers that can be expressed as the sum of a square and a cube, both greater than 1, in exactly 4 different ways.\nFor example, 5229225 is a palindromic number and it can be expressed in exactly 4 different ways:\n22852 + 203\n22232 + 663\n18102 + 1253\n11972 + 1563\n \nFind the sum of the five smallest such palindromic numbers.'
