# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Let x be a real number.\nA best approximation to x for the denominator bound d is a rational number r/s in reduced form, with s \xe2\x89\xa4 d, such that any rational number which is closer to x than r/s has a denominator larger than d:\n\n|p/q-x| < |r/s-x| \xe2\x87\x92 q > d\n\nFor example, the best approximation to \xe2\x88\x9a13 for the denominator bound 20 is 18/5 and the best approximation to \xe2\x88\x9a13 for the denominator bound 30 is 101/28.\n\nFind the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to \xe2\x88\x9an for the denominator bound 1012, where n is not a perfect square and 1 < n \xe2\x89\xa4 100000.'
