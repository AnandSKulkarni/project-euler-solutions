# Problem Statement 
'''
b'We wish to tile a rectangle whose length is twice its width.\nLet T(0) be the tiling consisting of a single rectangle.\nFor n > 0, let T(n) be obtained from T(n-1) by replacing all tiles in the following manner:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following animation demonstrates the tilings T(n) for n from 0 to 5:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet f(n) be the number of points where four tiles meet in T(n).\nFor example, f(1) = 0, f(4) = 82 and f(109) mod 177 = 126897180.\n\n\n\nFind f(10k) for k = 1018, give your answer modulo 177.'
