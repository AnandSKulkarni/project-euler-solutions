# Solution to Project Euler Problem #189 :: Tri-colouring a triangular grid

# Problem Statement 
'''
b"Consider the following configuration of 64 triangles:\n\n\n\nWe wish to colour the interior of each triangle with one of three colours: red, green or blue, so that no two neighbouring triangles have the same colour. Such a colouring shall be called valid. Here, two triangles are said to be neighbouring if they share an edge.\nNote: if they only share a vertex, then they are not neighbours. \n\nFor example, here is a valid colouring of the above grid:\n\n\nA colouring C' which is obtained from a colouring C by rotation or reflection is considered distinct from C unless the two are identical.\n\nHow many distinct valid colourings are there for the above configuration?"
