# Solution to Project Euler Problem #145 :: How many reversible numbers are there below one-billion?

# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Some positive integers n have the property that the sum [ n + reverse(n) ] consists entirely of odd (decimal) digits. For instance, 36 + 63 = 99 and 409 + 904 = 1313. We will call such numbers reversible; so 36, 63, 409, and 904 are reversible. Leading zeroes are not allowed in either n or reverse(n).\n\nThere are 120 reversible numbers below one-thousand.\n\nHow many reversible numbers are there below one-billion (109)?'
