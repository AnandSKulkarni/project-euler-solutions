# Problem Statement 
'''
b"A positive integer n is powerful if p2 is a divisor of n for every prime factor p in n.\n\n\nA positive integer n is a perfect power if n can be expressed as a power of another positive integer.\n\n\nA positive integer n is an Achilles number if n is powerful but not a perfect power. For example, 864 and 1800 are Achilles numbers: 864 = 25\xc2\xb733 and 1800 = 23\xc2\xb732\xc2\xb752.\n\n\nWe shall call a positive integer S a Strong Achilles number if both S and \xcf\x86(S) are Achilles numbers.1\nFor example, 864 is a Strong Achilles number: \xcf\x86(864) = 288 = 25\xc2\xb732. However, 1800 isn't a Strong Achilles number because: \xcf\x86(1800) = 480 = 25\xc2\xb731\xc2\xb751.\n\nThere are 7 Strong Achilles numbers below 104 and 656 below 108.\n\n\nHow many Strong Achilles numbers are there below 1018?\n\n\n1 \xcf\x86 denotes Euler's totient function."
