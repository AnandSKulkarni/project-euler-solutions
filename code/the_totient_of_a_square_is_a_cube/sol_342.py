# Solution to Project Euler Problem #342 :: The totient of a square is a cube
# 
# For more information see:

# Problem Statement 
'''
Consider the number 50.
502 = 2500 = 22 × 54, so φ(2500) = 2 × 4 × 53 = 8 × 53 = 23 × 53. 1
So 2500 is a square and  φ(2500) is a cube.


Find the sum of all numbers n, 1 < n < 1010 such that φ(n2) is a cube.


1 φ denotes Euler's totient function.
