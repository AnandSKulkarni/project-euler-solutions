# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The following game is a classic example of Combinatorial Game Theory:\n\nTwo players start with a strip of n white squares and they take alternate turns.\nOn each turn, a player picks two contiguous white squares and paints them black.\nThe first player who cannot make a move loses.\n\nIf n = 1, there are no valid moves, so the first player loses automatically.\nIf n = 2, there is only one valid move, after which the second player loses.\nIf n = 3, there are two valid moves, but both leave a situation where the second player loses.\nIf n = 4, there are three valid moves for the first player; she can win the game by painting the two middle squares.\nIf n = 5, there are four valid moves for the first player (shown below in red); but no matter what she does, the second player (blue) wins.\n\n\n\nSo, for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 5, there are 3 values of n for which the first player can force a win.\nSimilarly, for 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 50, there are 40 values of n for which the first player can force a win.\n\nFor 1 \xe2\x89\xa4 n \xe2\x89\xa4 1 000 000, how many values of n are there for which the first player can force a win?'
