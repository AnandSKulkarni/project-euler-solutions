# Problem Statement 
'''
b'Every divisor d of a number n has a complementary divisor n/d.\n\nLet f(n) be the sum of the greatest common divisor of d and n/d over all positive divisors d of n, that is\n$f(n)=\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{d|n}\\, \\text{gcd}(d,\\frac n d)$.\n\nLet F be the summatory function of f, that is\n$F(k)=\\displaystyle\\sum\\limits_{n=1}^k \\, f(n)$.\n\nYou are given that F(10)=32 and F(1000)=12776.\n\nFind F(1015).'
