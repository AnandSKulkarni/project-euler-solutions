# Problem Statement 
'''
b'The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,\n12 + 22 + ... + 102 = 385\nThe square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,\n(1 + 2 + ... + 10)2 = 552 = 3025\nHence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 \xe2\x88\x92 385 = 2640.\nFind the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.'
